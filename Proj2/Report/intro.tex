\section{Introduction}
In this project we have implemented two algorithms for global alignment; the dynamic exact global alignment and a 2-approximation algorithm. The intention of the project is to compare the two in column based score, and to see that the approximation algorithm is at most a factor 2 worse than the exact counterpart. 

Our implementation works well. Both the exact and the 2-approximation algorithm handles the input correctly, but some strange behavior was observed when testing with two sequences. This will be discussed further in the experiments section.
