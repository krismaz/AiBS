\section{Tests}
In order to verify the correct workings of the algorithms, we were faced with the problem of not having proper reference data, which made verifying our output quite difficult.
In an attempt at verifying the exact algorithm, we ran it on a small set of tests data. The results of the test data run was then manually compared with the input sequences to ensure that the sequences were not changed except from adding gaps, and they were scored using the supplied scoring program, to make sure that the calculated score was correct. Whether this alignment was optimal or not was not really something we can
