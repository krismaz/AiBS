\section{Conclusion}
We have experimented with the two algorithms, and must conclude that the linear global alignment is significantly faster on large datasets. As shown in the experiments section we can seee that the affine algorithm runs around 70\% slower than the linear counterpart. The theory names both algorithms to run in $O(n^{2})$, but the linear is faster. This can be attributed to the complexity of the affine alignment, seeing as the linear one is a bit simpler to implement.
