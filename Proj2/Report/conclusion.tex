\section{Conclusion}
We have implemented both exact and approximate methods for multiple sequence alignment, and compared their results. These results seem to show promising alignments from fairly simple approximation algorithms.
Worth noticing is also the speed difference between the exact and approximate algorithms. Though not documented in the results, they were quite noticeable, despite only aligning 3 sequences.
In general, we are quite pleased with the results of this project.
