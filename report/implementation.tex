\section{Methods}

We have implemented two algorithms: Global Linear Alignment and Global Affine Alignment. 

Our implementation is done in Python3, using the Numpy library for handling tables, and the BioPy library for parsing FASTA-files.
Everything was implemented using the pseudo-code from the slides from the lecture. 

The algorithms operate on strings (instead of alternatives like arrays or lists). They use a row by row approach as opposed to recursive memoization. 
When we use affine backtracking we alternate between row and column, to ensure linear backtracking performance.
