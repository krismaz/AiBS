\section{Conclusion}

Through our work in this report, we have managed to implement different positioning schemes and distance measurements, and we have shown that it is possible to determine positions quite accurately from a set of signal strength readings.
Finally, we have found a method of generating model-based data from theoretical models of wi-fi signal strength, and used this to experimentally compare the model-based solutions to the empirical, showing a noticeable but acceptable degradation of positioning accuracy.
