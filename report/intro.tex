\section{Introduction}
In this project we have implemented the linear and the affine global alignment. The point of the project is to compare the two by running time performance. We have set up the experiments to try different sequences lengths, with the standard DNA alphabet of 'ACGT'.

Our implementations works without faults, completing the example data with the correct alignments, and correct scores. Our implementation also supports custom alphabets, and varying cost matrixes.
