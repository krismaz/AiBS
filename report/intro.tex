\section{Introduction}
In this project we have implemented linear and the affine global alignment. The point of the project is to compare the two methods of aligning sequences in termes of running time. We have set up experiments to try different sequence lengths, with the standard DNA alphabet of 'ACGT'.

Our implementations works seems to work well, completing the example data with the correct alignments, and correct scores. Our implementation also supports custom alphabets, and varying cost matrixes.
