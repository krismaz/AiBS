\section{Introduction}

In this project we will be working with wireless positioning.
We will examine different methods for determining user position based on wi-fi access point signal strength measurements, and discus the choices made in their implementations.
Finally, we will be experimenting with the accuracy of different parameters of the positioning system, and compare the performance of model-based data to empirical measurements.
