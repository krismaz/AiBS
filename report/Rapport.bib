@Inproceedings {RADAR,
abstract     = {<p>The proliferation of mobile computing devices and local-area wireless networks
                has fostered a growing interest in location-aware systems and services. In this
                paper we present RADAR, a radio-frequency (RF)-based system for locating and
                tracking users inside buildings. RADAR operates by recording and processing
                signal strength information at multiple base stations positioned to provide
                overlapping coverage in the area of interest. It combines empirical measurements
                with signal propagation modeling to determine user location and thereby enable
                location-aware services and applications. We present experimental results that
                demonstrate the ability of RADAR to estimate user location with a high degree of
                accuracy.</p>},
